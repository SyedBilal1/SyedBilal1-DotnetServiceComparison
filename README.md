## Introduction
The **SyedBilal1-DotnetServiceComparison** project serves as a comparative analysis of .NET-based services. This repository demonstrates the implementation, performance, and scalability of different service architectures in .NET.

Whether you are comparing microservices, monolithic applications, or serverless setups, this repository provides a structured and practical approach to evaluate and learn from various .NET service models.

---

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns for easy comparison.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate performance under various scenarios.
- **Scalability Demonstrations**: Understand how each service type scales.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Deploy services with Docker for consistency.
- **Customizable Examples**: Add your own services or configurations for comparison.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyedBilal1/SyedBilal1-DotnetServiceComparison.git
   cd SyedBilal1-DotnetServiceComparison
   ```

2. Build the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Run the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Access the services at `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with the respective service port).

---

## Usage
1. **Run Tests**: Execute performance and scalability tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

2. **Modify Configuration**: Adjust settings in the `appsettings.json` file located in each service's directory to customize behavior.

3. **Add New Services**: Create a new directory under `Services/` and follow the existing structure to add a custom service for comparison.

---

## Technologies Used
- **C# (59.9%)**: Core programming language used for service implementations.
- **Docker (40.1%)**: Containerization technology for deployment.
- Additional tools and frameworks include:
  - ASP.NET Core
  - Entity Framework Core
  - xUnit for testing
